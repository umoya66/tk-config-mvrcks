Maya project folders
- http://www.bryanray.name/wordpress/the-maya-project-directory-structure/

- sourceimages -: The third of the most well used folders in your project
  directory, the sourceimages folder is where Maya will look for texture
  maps of all kinds, including image planes.
- data: Fluid and nParticle caches will show up here, with a folder for
  each scene with a cache.
- particles: Particle disk caches, but not nParticle caches, will go into
  this directory. I'm sure there are other particle-related files that
  will go in here, as well, but I haven't yet encountered them.
